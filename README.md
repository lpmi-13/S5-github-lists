# Super Simple Service Scraper Setup - Github Lists

This is a service I'm going to run (in docker probably), and then run it somehwere and scrape metrics on prometheus to learn how to do _all that_.

## running the service locally

```bash
$ npm install
$ node grabRepos.js
```

and you'll have a tasty `javascript-results.txt` file in your directory!

...currently working on putting this into a container.
